simply put: living without documentation feels like dying. i have spent the last however long without writing about my *current* opinions and knowledge, and it feels like i've lost those parts of myself.

you may say "why don't you just journal then" – i do! but some of my thoughts i'd like to share with those who care to listen & find them helpful.

am i a great writer? probably not, idk, but i think it's still worth trying.

## the distinction between journaling and blogging

for me, writing in my journal is a way to reflect on my own thoughts and actions, day-by-day. it's kind of a tracking system for my mood and where i've been. i think i do it differently to most people as i don't start with "Dear diary...", rather, i'm talking to my future self? it's hard to explain, but i'm sure i'll cover that in a future article.

and so, blogging is completely different for me – i don't plan on writing too regularly or for the chore of it, rather when i find something interesting or useful to share, i'll write about it. i'm very sure a lot of my opinions will be ill-formed, but i'll try to be honest and transparent about my journey & i would like to note that **they are my mine**, and do not represent any group i'm a part of. i find that a lot of people like to silo their opinions, and i don't think that's a good thing.

and i suppose i've also revealed this idea that i think differentiates this blog from other tech-bro blogs: i don't *really* want to write about the latest tech breakthrough, rather things that i stumble upon in my journey/some story along the way.

furthermore, i increasingly find the need to post edgy-one-liners on X, and i think perhaps i should have a place to explain some of them... and probably keep them off there lol

tldr: it's freeform!

so what i'm hoping to do is not flood the internet with more garbage, but rather have a space that may be of interest to *someone* who wants to see where i'm at in my journey.

p.s. feel free to reach out to me if you would like to discuss anything i've written on, i'm open to criticism/feedback/etc.
